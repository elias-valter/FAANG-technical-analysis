# FAANG stock analysis
This technical analysis takes a look at the FAANG stocks concerning the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence, Simple Moving Average, Bullish Engulfing & Bearish Engulfing, Exponential Moving Average, Relative Strength Index and Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average.

I analysed the stock data provided by "Yahoo finance" and used Python including the talib libary.
